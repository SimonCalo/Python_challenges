This problem is the same as the one given by Daily Coding Problem number 142 [Hard].
This problem is challenging but not too complicated.

You're given a string consisting solely of (, ), and *. * can represent either a (, ), or an empty string. Determine whether the parentheses are balanced.

For example, (()* and (*) are balanced. )*( is not balanced.

I provide two solutions for this problem, one which is a brute force solution, and one which is more refined and runs in O(N) time.
I also include a script to check that both solutions give the same results.
