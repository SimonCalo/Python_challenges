This problem is the same as the one given by Daily Coding Problem number 103 [Medium].

I find this problem quite challenging and fun. I recommend it to people that have good experience with coding challenges.

I slightly modified the return of the function in case no substring containing all the characters can be constructed, but is equivalent to the original requirements of the problem.

Here is the text for the given problem:

Given a string and a set of characters, return the shortest substring containing all the characters in the set.

For example, given the string "figehaeci" and the set of characters {a, e, i}, you should return "aeci".

If there is no substring containing all the characters in the set, return an empty string.
