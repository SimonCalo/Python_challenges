This problem is the same as the one given by Daily Coding Problem number 114 [Hard].

I find this problem challenging and fun, but not too complicated.

Here is the text for the given problem:

Given a string and a set of delimiters, reverse the words in the string while maintaining the relative order of the delimiters. For example, given "hello/world:here", return "here/world:hello"

Follow-up: Does your solution work for the following cases: "hello/world:here/", "hello//world:here"?
