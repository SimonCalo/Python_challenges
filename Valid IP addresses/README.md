This problem is the same as the one given by Daily Coding Problem number 213 [Medium].

Given a string of digits, generate all possible valid IP address combinations.

IP addresses must follow the format A.B.C.D, where A, B, C, and D are numbers between 0 and 255. Zero-prefixed numbers, such as 01 and 065, are not allowed, except for 0 itself.

For example, given "2542540123", you should return ['254.25.40.123', '254.254.0.123'].

Here, I propose both my solution and a solution generated by ChatGPT after feeding it the description of the problem above. I also include a final file containing a comparison of the performance of the two algorithms.
